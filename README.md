# Pacman-Pathfinding
A browser-based Pac-Man clone built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript, featuring Dijkstra pathfinding for intelligent ghost AI.

# Pac-Man Web Game

A fully playable **Pac-Man clone** built with **HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project recreates the classic arcade game while demonstrating modern web-development,
game-loop architecture, and AI path-finding.

---

## Project Overview
This game was developed as an **individual computing project** and is accompanied by a full
technical report (`pacman_project.pdf`) and the original assignment brief (`indCompProject23.pdf`).

Key objectives:
* Re-create the core mechanics of the original Pac-Man.
* Implement **intelligent ghost behaviour** using **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for shortest-path pursuit.
* Deliver a smooth, responsive browser experience without external frameworks.

---

## Features
* **HTML5 Canvas Rendering** – All graphics drawn and animated directly on the canvas.
* **Keyboard Controls** – Arrow keys or WASD for smooth, real-time movement.
* **Ghost AI** – Each ghost calculates the optimal path to Pac-Man using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
* **Scoring & Lives System** – Tracks pellets eaten, score, and remaining lives.
* **Sound Effects** – Classic pellet “chomp” and background audio for an authentic feel.
* **Optimised Game Loop** – Consistent 30 FPS rendering for fluid play.

---

## Technology Stack
* **HTML5 / CSS3** – Structure and styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic, input handling, collision detection, and AI.
* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Real-time pathfinding for ghost movement.

---

## How to Run
1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Use **Arrow keys** or **WASD** to control Pac-Man and collect all pellets while avoiding the ghosts.

No server setup or build tools required.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Front-End Development** – Building a complete browser application without frameworks.
* **Game Programming** – Designing a game loop, collision detection, and real-time rendering.
* **Artificial Intelligence** – Implementing Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm for dynamic enemy AI.
* **Software Engineering** – Planning, documenting, and delivering a large individual project.

---

## Notes
* The core game is complete and fully playable.  
* Potential future improvements include enhanced power-pellet logic, additional levels,
  and mobile-touch controls but I have bigger projects to focus on at the moment. Maybe in the possible future.

Developed as a capstone **Individual Computing Project** to showcase strong
programming, problem-solving, and documentation skills.
